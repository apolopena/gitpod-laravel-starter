Starts the hot reload server on port 3005 by starting Laravel Mix Watch, which then starts browser-sync.
The hot-reload 'start' command should only be called after the hot-reload 'setup' command has been called.
browser-sync spawns the hot-reload webpack server on port 3005. A preview browser is automatically opened.
The hot reload server will proxy whatever default development server you have set in starter.ini

Notes:
If you are serving dynamic content such as PHP or compiled javascript using a server other than what
was set as the development server in starter.ini, then the hot reload server will not proxy the correct 
port, and will fail. If you need to change this you can edit the hot reload code snippet in webpack.mix.js
or change your default server in starter.ini.

Usage:
  hot-reload start [FLAG]

Flags:
  -h, --help       show help for this command
