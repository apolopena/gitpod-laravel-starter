This command should only be called after the hot-reload 'setup' and 'start' commands have been called.

Notes:
This command can be called from any terminal. The terminal that is running Laravel Mix Watch
(invoked by yarn) will be sent a ctrl+c signal.
The hot-reload 'stop' command will not close the preview browser.

  hot-reload stop [FLAG]

Flags:
  -h, --help       show help for this command
